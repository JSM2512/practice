   <h3> Why study Abroad?</h3> 
   <br>
 <h5> Reasons to why study abroad <br>
 
1. Study abroad to explore a new culture
It is one thing to experience a country’s culture when you visit for vacation, but it’s completely different when you immerse yourself in the culture as you live and study there. Stepping out of India to study in a foreign country will open the door to cultural experiences, preparing for fafsa for international students, wes evaluation,  unique customs, new languages and unfamiliar traditions. You become part of your new environment when you study abroad, contributing your own unique background and ideas while learning new customs and discovering new ways of doing things. Seeing the world through an open-minded perspective makes you a culturally aware global citizen, and that is a passport that will benefit you wherever you go.
<br>
<br>
2. Become More Responsible While Studying in a Foreign Country
Until now, you may have lived with your parents or guardians, but when you study abroad, you will be in charge of everything from your well-being to your education. You will be responsible for the decisions and the consequences that you face when you choose to study abroad. This independence will prove useful in the highly competitive career world and you will learn to enjoy the excitement of knowing that you are in control of your life.
<br>
<br>
3. Build a Network of Friends From Around the World
One of the most obvious reasons to study abroad is to meet people from different places. Creating an international circle of friends is a huge benefit of studying abroad – imagine having friends both in your home country and in the country you attend university. Imagine having two home countries! You become friends with people in your classes, on your sports teams, in your society, fraternity or sorority, or in your student organization. And these friends will forever be part of your most cherished memories from your time abroad.
<br>
<br>
4. Experience a different education style
Indian students used to a passive style of learning will get to experience a more engaging and active learning style when studying abroad. This may involve active learning through class participation, dialogue exchange, case studies and practical off- and on-campus experiences that make learning fun and meaningful. Who knows – maybe the key to unlocking your potential is in the way your future professor provides feedback or encourages student discussions in class, or maybe it is the size of the class or how much time you spend in the lab.
